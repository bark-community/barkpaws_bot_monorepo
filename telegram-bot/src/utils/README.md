**calculateTransactionFees(amount)**:

This function estimates transaction fees based on the provided token amount. It assumes a fixed fee per token and multiplies it by the amount. This can be useful for providing users with an estimate of the fees they might incur during a token swap.

1. **`isValidWalletAddress(walletAddress)`**: This function validates wallet addresses using a checksum. It checks if the provided address is a string of 42 characters starting with "SOL". Although it returns `true` for any address in the current implementation, a real implementation would perform checksum validation to ensure the address is valid.

2. **`formatTokenAmount(amount)`**: This function formats token amounts by rounding the amount to two decimal places and appending the token symbol "BARK". This is helpful for displaying token amounts in a user-friendly format.

3. **`handleError(error)`**: This function handles errors by logging the error message to the console. It's a simple error handler that can be used to log errors encountered during token swap operations.
